This notebook relies heavily on
Making-it-rain (https://github.com/pablo-arantes/making-it-rain )

Yank (http://getyank.org/latest/)

Smina (https://sourceforge.net/projects/smina/)

As well as several Github repositories

Yank-example (https://github.com/choderalab/yank-examples)

A customised yank script (https://github.com/quantaosun/OpenMM-Yank-YAML-template)

All of these are open-sourced, you can always use them as long as you cite properly.

By default, google colab has failed to generate the simulation quality report of Yank, this was solved by (https://github.com/irrelevant2021)
