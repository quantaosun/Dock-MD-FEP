# **Dock-MD-FEP**

---
Docking, Molecular dynamic(MD), and Free energy perturbation (FEP) are important modelling methods in medicinal chemistry.

This Jupyter notebook shows how to run a Three-in-one simulation, i.e., docking, MD and FEP, with freely available GPU(and CPU) from Google Colab.

**This notebook is based on**
- The MD simulation is based on [OpenMM](https://openmm.org/) and [Making-it-rain](https://twitter.com/pablitoarantes)

- The FEP simulation is based on [Yank](http://getyank.org/latest/)

- The docking is based on Autodock Vina derived [Smina](https://github.com/mwojcikowski/smina)


- Other open-soured packages like [Open-Sourced-PyMOL](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pymol-open-source)/  [OpenBabel](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel)/ [Rdkit](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit) etc.
